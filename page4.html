					<div class ="desc">  While in the Gardens, please refrain from littering and smoking so as to create wondrous experiences for everyone. Please do not use control aerial objects as well, ranging from kites to remote-controlled planes, drones and 
					other similar devices. As part of our efforts to enjoy nature, picnics are allowed in the Gardens' grounds, other than in the Conservatories.

					<div class ="desc">  As the Gardens are mainly outdoors and in Singapore's heat, it will be good to bring reuseable water bootles to keep hydrated. If needed, do bring along mosquito repellants as well. Also, to beat the heat, it is encouraged
					to bring along sun-protection devices such as sunscreen, caps and umbrellas if you are prone to sunburn.

					<div class ="desc">  If you would like to learn more about our Gardens and their flora, we have plenty of guided tours around the Bay Gardens with our experienced tour guides. You can also choose to have the tour in a cruiser, for a different experience.
					In the Conservatories, we have audio guides (in English, Mandarin and Japanese) available for rental as well.
